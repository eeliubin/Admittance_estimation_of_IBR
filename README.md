# Admittance estimation of IBR

This repository contains the MATLAB codes used to reproduce the results in the preprint:

W. Zhou, B. Liu, N. Mohammed and B. Bahrani, "An Efficient Method to Estimate Admittance of Black-boxed Inverter-based Resources for Varying Operating Points", 10.36227/techrxiv.24056100.


This source code is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty.

We do request that publications in which this admittance estimation algorithm is adopted, explicitly acknowledge that fact by citing the above mentioned paper.
